## Overview and Origin

###  Who is Frollo?
Frollo are at the forefront of Australia's move to adopting the Open Banking set of frameworks and enabling local FinTechs to do the same.  Frollo's ambitions aren't limited to Australia as they partner with FinTechs and legacy players globally, empowering them to effectively adopt their respective Open Banking standards [[1][1]].

Frollo is a strange little name, made up of two words, "Front" and "Follow" and hints at their purpose-driven approach, which is to "help people feel good about money" [[2][2]].

Frollo's humble beginnings originated in 2015 with its founder and current CEO, Gareth Gumbley, who grew up in similarly humble surroundings, requiring that he have a side-hustle or two, earning his living and ensuring his dreams and goals were kept on track.

With Gareth's earlier career in Finance and Technology and desire to help others, he started Frollo with the purpose of seeing Australians correct their relationship with money, specifically to help improve people's lives through increased financial wellbeing and thereby reducing, related stress.

The initial offerings from Frollo were a free mobile app for the man-on-the-street, thus kicking off their B2C product and then furthering their mission, started on their B2B offerings by building a platform which enabled other organisations to further Frollo's mission of increasing people's financial wellbeing; this platform allowed those companies to do the same for their own customers.  This platform became the precursor to the Open Banking platform it is today, enabling them to participate in the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Open Banking pilo, and become the first Open Banking ADR (accredited data recipient).

How has Frollo been able to achieve their current position in Australia's Open Banking domain?  Well, Frollo's funding history is fairly simple; it does not span years and multiple rounds of funding, and has a similarly scarce amount of publicly available information on the amounts involved.  This is remarkable, given where they find themselves placed in their domain.

Here is a short and sweet timeline of their funding history: -

| Year  | Funding Description |
| ----- |:------------------- |
| 2015  | In true Frollo style, the company was initially funded by friends and family |
| 2018  | Frollo received a grant by Metlife (Sept. 2018 [[3][3]]) to expand and improve their free B2C App |
| 2019  | Frollo acquired Hip Money (Sept. 2019 [[4][4]]) a small Brisbane-based FinTech, primarily for their AI enabled App which focused on consumer saving and debt elimination; remarkably and similarly aligned to their primary goal |
| 2020  | Frollo was acquired by NextGen.Net (July 2020 [[5][5]]) for an undisclosed amount.  NextGen.Net acquired Frollo, seeking their Open Banking solutions which closely align to their own Mortgage and Lending data ecosystem |

## Business Activities:

### Oh, the problems we solve

Frollo seems to have been started at just the right time for the domain they find themselves in and the problems they look to solve.  Australia's Financial landscape, along with its banks and other institutions have not had the easiest of times recently.  The advent of the Banking Royal Commission, a.k.a The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, brought to light the ultimate power these financial institutions wield over their customers, smaller institutions reliant on them, and even *some* judicial bodies [[6][6]].

One of the fortuitous events that took place at much the same time as Australia's Banking Royal Commission was ACCC's *Productivity Commission Inquiry* into competition within the Australian Financial System [[7][7]]. Its main recommendations were for the protection of customer data and ensuring the easy transition of a customers between financial institutions.  This had, to a degree, already had the wheels of motion turning in Europe and the United Kingdom with the UK in 2016 adopting parts of the EU's Payment Services Directive (PSD2) on the back of their own inquiry into the competitiveness of their financial industry and institutions.  The UK's Open Banking directives were a direct result of a ruling by the their Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to ***specifically allow licenced Fintech startups access to their transaction (and other) data*** [[8][8]]!

The rest is history.

*Enter Frollo!! And the power of Open Banking ...*

The average Joe wants to simply go about his business, be treated fairly, and not have to worry about whether or not the institutions he has entrusted his finances to are on his side and not taking advantage of him.  Knowing the findings of the various inquiries into financial institutions, it is not a far stretch to declare that the latter is unfortunately true.

### Customers, Use Cases and Competitive Advantage

Frollo, with both its B2C/B2B white-label financial wellbeing and Personal Financial Management (PFM) consumer app, along with its B2B financial data integration SaaS platform, is well placed to resolve the problems still so prevalent in the industry.  Its target market is almost anyone who has financial data and a smartphone, wanting to make more healthy financial decisions or any licenced financial institution, legacy or Fintech startup, and have them do the same for their customers as well as capitalise on what the platform allows and rapidly scale their entrance into the modern banking fray.  Who wouldn't want to capitalise on the gold mine that is consumer data?

Of course, potential entrants could build their own platforms, but they would need to become registered participants of the Open Banking ecosystem, administer their own data-consent and insight systems to remain competitive, nevermind become a competitor in the space.  This openness, transparency and control is what consumers have come to expect and now demand.

Frollo has been working with the ACCC from the start of its Open Banking trials and through that time has built up a number of assets that set it apart from any number of players in the Open Banking domain globally, nevermind Australia, where it is the leader.

#### Frollo's Tech Stack

Frollo has built up its open banking solutions ecosystem, encompassing an AI engine, any number of APIs, partner integrations and powerful homegrown components.  They are inherently cloud native, using AWS (Amazon Web Services) as their primary Cloud Vendor and making use of AWS's API Gateway, their Shield, SageMaker and WAF (Web Application Firewall) [[9][9]].  These form the SaaS platform and enable access and use of the gold mine that is consumer transactional data.  The consumer app, as previously described, as important as it is in the way in which the information is presented to the user, is but meaningless and empty pixels without the power the platform provides it.

Frollo's Open Banking solutions [[10][10]] and use of key technologies: -

| Frollo Solution | Technology | Description |
| --------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| CDR Gateway | APIs, Big Data, SDKs, Cloud, AI | The platform! A powerful solution for consent management and CDR data collection and transaction enrichment |
| Product Ref. Data Portal        | APIs, Cloud, SDKs | Simple and future-proof ways to reference and publish compliant Open Banking product data APIs |
| Statement of Financial Position | APIs, Big Data, Cloud, AI | Real-time and streamlined credit decision using CDR data and AI |
| Data Enrichment APIs            | APIs, Cloud, Big Data, AI | Unstructured CDR data turned into meaningful insights using AI.  Categorisation-as-a-Service; Multi data sources; single API; always improving |
| Data Holder Testing | APIs, SDKs, Big Data, Cloud, AI | Open Banking Compliance preparation; "Data Holder" testing, saving time and money; creating confidence with high standards |

The key differentiators of Frollo's solutions is data enrichment, making extensive use of Machine Learning with its data.  Frollo run most workloads on AWS, having chosen the platform for its data and analytics capability, built-in security controls, and Machine Learning tools.

## Landscape and Roadmaps

As a fairly young FinTech, Frollo currently operates within the Open Banking landscape.  The landscape is driven by the advent of Open Banking directives which have turned the tables on the ownership of consumer data in favour of consumers, enabling its primary tenet - Consumer Data Rights; the right that a consumer has over their own data and their choice as to who can access their data, and how it used.

Open Banking and its implication for data ownership does not stop at financial data for financial institutions, but is extending to other industries, including Telcos and Energy.  A wealth of data, slowly opening up to those who are ready for it.

### Frollo's Impact

Frollo primarily sees itself as an enabler of disruption and is willing to partner with those startups or even incumbents that are willing to become more nimble and focus on the future of banking, i.e. its open and consumer-focussed future.  With its early adoption of Open Banking standards, open and consumer-focused approach, their platform has grown to being dominant with the processing of 95% of all Open Banking related activity!

Their approach to Open Banking is paying off with a number of high-profile announcements in recent months [[11][11]]: -
- May 2021
  - Frollo and EML partner in providing Australiaâ€™s first  Open Banking Payments Platform
- April 2021
  - ANZ partners with Frollo for access to Open Banking data
  - Canstar partners with Frollo to launch PFM app
  - Virgin Money Australia launches new digital bank and partners with Frollo on their PFM platform

The effects of what Open Banking has been able to accomplish is evident in the partnership between Volt Bank and Frollo, enabling Volt earlier in their history (while not yet in possession of a full banking license) to quickly gain consumer trust and help form their own offerings.  The benefits of this open approach to banking is most evident in the recent announcement of the partnership between Volt and RailsBank Asia Pacific to provide Banking-as-a-Service, enabling the bank to enter the Australian market [[12][12]].  Volt would not have been able to partner with Railsbank would it not have been for its access to Frollo's platform and the power it unleashes.

### Competition Anyone?

At this point, it would not be inaccurate, to make the determination that Frollo is the leader of this domain in Australia, and while it remains an enabler of other disruptors, startups and forward thinking FinTechs, it will remain on top as it has already accomplished the creation of a robust platform already being used by a number of customers with a bright future.

Larger (also read as older) financial organisations are doing a number of things within the Open Banking landscape, but seem more interested in grabbing a slice of the product pie, e.g. loans, cards, insurance, etc. by fleshing out platforms within their own legacy ecosystems, and not focussing on the biggest benefit of Open Banking, namely the avalanche of data that it opens up [[13][13]].

One could argue that these incumbents already have all the data they need internally and the rush to build out BaaS platforms and rent out their licences is something they could focus on, but they forget, **the data isn't theirs**.  If they ignore the owners of the data, they risk them (their consumers/customers) leaving in their droves and take their data with them.

## Frollo's next move: some recommendations

It is difficult to know what strategies Frollo has up its sleeve, however assuming I had the ear of the CEO, I'd put a number of recommendations to him and his Team.
- Frollo should not wait for the Open Banking timeline to roll out, but begin preparing for what may not be obvious:
  - With the consent of consumers (their own Frollo consumer app users), start to seek out financial institutions, not part of the first tranche of Open Banking participants (legacy big 5), i.e. smaller or newer entrants into the Fintech space, new neo banks, payments or wealth management startups and incentivise them to use their platform.  This will expand the disruption that their platform enables, but similarly gain newer forms of data in potentially a younger demographic and unlock differing behaviors from encumbent/ordinary CDR data.  
  Where do Gen-Y consumers generate their incomes and spend their cash?
  - Start to build out APIs in anticipation of the onboarding of Telco and Energy into the Open Banking / Open Data landscape.  Capitalising on these new sources of CDR would open up the potential for Frollo to expand their influence within Big Data and AI.  Not to mention a whole new source of disruption.
- Frollo's platform, as powerful and capable as it is, is currently one which is centralised.  I'd motivate for them to start to think about decentralising.  This is both an emerging macro trend, but more importantly, is about the rights of the consumers whose data their platform exists to serve.  They could make use of differing big data and cloud technologies to shard their platform's capabilities.  Thinking about using Blockchain protocols (Etherium is continually improving, with the introduction of sharding imminent) to enable decentralisation.  As Frollo grows, and takes on more data, the temptation will be to keep growing and scale the current platform, centrally; this should be avoided.
- Frollo is already expanding into payments (as is evident with their latest partnering with EML - see previous reference).  They could expand upon their soon-to-be new foray into the blockchain's capabilities and capitalise on the openness that it provides.  This will be in line with what FinTech consumers will continue to want and demand.

### Concluding thoughts

Frollo has a bright future, precisely because they have placed the consumer at the forefront of who they serve.  Fortuitous or not, the Open Banking standards and directives, similarly place the consumer - the man-on-the-street - and their rights over their data at the forefront of what they do.

The Open Banking domain is still in its infancy, and as it opens up and creates opportunity for those who engage in it, it is those companies who place consumer data and consumer's rights over that data first, and then shout that fact from the mountaintops - while squeezing every last drop of value out of - will be those that rise to the top.

Frollo is all about the consumer; be like Frollo :)
